For learing kanji I recommend this deck: <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/95480491" rel="nofollow">https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/95480491</a>

The main source for the vocabulary of this deck is the Genki I Deck from here:

Because it might take a while till I'll do a deck like this for Genki II, you can use the Deck from the link above for the Genki II vocabulary (without Sounds).
